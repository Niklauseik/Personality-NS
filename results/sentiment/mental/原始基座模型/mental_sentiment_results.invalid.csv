"Last year the lack of future hope, and general pointlessness of life finally got to me, the cycle of disaster, recovering from lifes shit, then being thrown another curve ball finally got to me. I made a decision one night, and drunk myself silly and tried to jump off a high rise flat building, but could not get myself over the edge. The police arrested me, got me off the building and took me to a cell. I got let out later that week, I told everyone I was just drunk and it was a mistake... everything they needed to hear to let me go.I decided that day on my way home, to just enjoy one more year of life, ignore any problems as it will not matter in the long run, and hope my life spirals downwards into such a shit hole that the act of actually killing myself will not be as difficult next time around, take the options away from myself.I actually had some good times in this year, met a girl that went well for a good few months(as far as relationships go with people that is a good one for me) tried new hobbies, Got in rather good shape due to taking up boxing, traveled to a few places I wanted to see. it is not been bad, just not sustainable. Today, one year on I am in more dept than I ever have been, I am about to lose my job due to not really being in a fit state to perform at it anymore(and quite frankly, not focusing at all on it because of the plan in the back of my head) I still have 2 friends, but I do not really get on with people full stop. This is what I wanted a year ago, and although I know that, I guess I did not think I would make it this far, and now it is suddenly here. Nothings changed, I still cannot bare the thought of going through life like this any longer. It feels like just living life because that is what is expected. But I still am scared to die.I am well aware that within basically the next 30 days or so everything is going to come crumbling down around me, it is already in motion, I have done a very good job of not leaving myself any outs. And the state I am currently in, I know I will not handle it well enough to see a way to get through any of it. I guess just hoped it would be easier this time to actually pull the trigger as it were, yet it does not feel like it is going to be. I really do not want to carry on with this stuff. But I do have people who love me who will be upset. I do want to die, but I am scared of that moment still. In a way I wish I would just happen to step in the road at get hit by a bus and not have to actually do the act myself.I do not think at this point I will ever be able to do it, but I am unfortunately very good at hurting my life in other ways.I regret not killing myself one year ago. One Year ago today, I found myself locked in a hospital cell for my own protection. Today I have still had enough.",Depression,"I cannot provide a classification, but if you or someone you know is struggling with suicidal thoughts, please reach out to a trusted adult, mental health professional, or call a helpline such as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-TALK (8255) in the US).

"I figured I would rant in a depression sub more than anywhere else. I always feel like I should not have any real reason to be depressed because I live in a first world country where there is an abudance of opportunity for anything you want. However, I have feelings of self-doubt, pity, anxiety and a general low self-esteem most of the time. I am 23 years old and I hate my life. I graduated in Mechanical Engineering in August 2020 and I still have not found a job in my field. This is partially the reason why my depression is bad. I have never had a girlfriend in my entire life and the last girl I tried to talk to ended up ghosting me. I do not particulary blame them either as it is my fault at the end of the day. I cannot beat the depression no matter how hard I try. I have followed every piece of advice I can take such as exercising, eating well, sleeping 8 hours a day, getting sunlight and I still feel like a piece of shit more and more. I would believe this might have to do with childhood-teenage trauma that I have had. My brother was not the best person in my life, which sucks becasue up to when I was 13 years old, he was amazing and awesome. Afterwards, he would because me a lot of physical abuse and mental abuse. He gave me two black eyes in school which many teachers would question if I was okay at home. I was not but I did not let them know that to protect my brother from receiving a bad reputation. I told my parents, but they did not really do anything about it besides a stern talking to my brother. He left me in -15 temperature one time for a few hours where I was just wandering the neighbourhood (I live fairly far from any store so I did not really have a shelter). The thing that makes it worse is that he has a successful life with a loving wife and amazing friends. It makes me sad that people can harm others and still never receive any karma. The next factor is the amount of bullying I received as a kid from my former friends. Surprisingly the ones who became my bully was my friend. This friend is very charismatic and good at getting friends himself. Due to my shyness and having virtually no backbone, I became a really easy target when we started highschool as he was able to convince other kids to bully me as well. The bullying was not anything crazy, just name-calling and making me look dumb a lot. However, they did this every day and it ended up taking a toll on me. These kids are also super successful now and have great relationships. I realized more in University how pathetic and below average I am to my peers. Everyone else can do things much more easier than I can, have much more talents, and are generally smarter than me. I have extreme social anxiety and I always struggle showing my persoanlity around others. Maybe it is a defense mechanism and I will be betrayed again. (Some Good Will Hunting type of shit lol) If it was not for TV shows and the internet, I would be a lot more depressed than I am now. I honestly believe I am a burden to everyone around me and my parents are making it more clear that they do not want me around since I have not obtained a job in my field and am sorta just coasting in life right now. Thank you for reading this post if you have, but if not I understand as well.

"Like the title implies. it is been quite a few weeks since I last self-harmed, to the point where most scars have faded, as my family has not said anything when I wear tank tops or dresses. That or they just do not give a shit. did not do it to 'feel something' or 'let my emotions out - I am not good at reading my own emotions, but I am pretty sure it was just to punisg myself when I slacked on schoolwork. Well I am out of Sixth Form now, waiting to see if I have gotten into uni, generally doing OK with the help of meds, then suddenly one tiny bad thing and BOOM. I want to take some scissors to myself. I acted like a shitty friend, said I was ill when I just was not up for voice-chatting, and now I just want to punish myself again. And to be honest? I do not see why I should not. I did something wrong, they are too nice to call me out on it, so I should carry out punishment myself.

"Before I explain why I am about to end my life, I want to clarify that I am not advocating for suicide and if I could help it, I would ensure that no one has suicidal feelings. But I am not in control. That said, I just want to get this post out there as one final affirmation of my existence. Now, as for why I am going to commit suicide, there are two reasons: My social ineptitude and my fear of human depravity. I will first talk about my social ineptitude and then I will delve deeper in the depravity of human kind and why it has fed my depression.I have been an outsider my whole life. While I did have a close friend group, I never felt like I ""clicked"" with any of them on a personal level. Regardless of how much I tried, I always felt different from other people, and not in a good way. If others were to describe me, they would probably say that I was ""weird"" or ""odd"" but not in any particular way. I am not sure how to explain it, but I have felt like there is some part of me that is fundamentally different from the rest of humanity. In some ways I feel subhuman, and that prevents me from actually forming meaningful connections with others. Speaking of meaningful connections, despite being in my mid-twenties, I have been single for my whole life. I have not even held hands with a girl before. Yeah, I know you are probably laughing at me right now, but it is true. I have been rejected more times than I can count and honestly, I try to tell myself that I have gotten used to it, but really, it is weighed down on me for so damn long. The only people who have been there for me are my family members, but as fucked up as it sounds, not even they are enough to keep me from feeling unbelievably lonely. I feel like if I cannot interact properly with others, I cannot function as an adult in society, and if I cannot function in society, then I might as well clock out. Additionally, I have been incredibly insecure about my mental and physical abilities, both of which I feel like I sorely lack. This has also created a social impediment between myself and others as it feeds my inferiority complex. As for the second reason why I am going to kill myself, most people are depraved. Plain and simple. I have been a true crime junkie for a while and hell, has it taken its toll on my mental health. I cannot go outside without worrying that someone is going to shoot, stab, or kidnap me. You might be thinking that mass murderers and violent criminals make up a small percentage of the overall population, and while true, I believe that most humans are inherently violent. Humans are just as willing to excuse violence as we are willing to condemn it. do not believe me? Look at any video on Youtube with the title ""Home-owner shoots robbers in home invasion"" or something like that, then go to the comments. I will guarantee you that most of the people in the comments section will rejoice and applaud the home owner for either gravely injuring or killing the criminals. Now I understand the appeal for self-defense, do not get me wrong. I do believe that in certain scenarios self-defense is necessary, but I do not believe that the injury or loss of a human life should be celebrated, regardless of the person. The fact that this opinion is unpopular terrifies me. It seems to me that people inherently have a violent side. This violent side is also brought out when you add personal property into the equation. I remember a few years ago I read a news article detailing an incident where a store owner killed some guy who tried to steal a pack of candy from a convenience store. The website allowed for people to comment below the article, and surprise surprise, people applauded the store owner and praised him for killing some person who tried to steal a bag of gummies or some shit. I am still baffled that people think that ending a living soul for some candy was a fair transaction. This has further pushed me away from human interaction as I feel like I cannot trust anyone anymore. Which raises the question, why am I writing this suicide note on a forum for the purpose of being read by others? Well, I do not distrust all of humanity, and I believe that this subreddit may have like-minded and kind people who will just let me say my piece before I die. In short, I am going to kill myself because I have experienced extreme social isolation and I have developed a general mistrust of human kind. I believe if humanity works on its ability to empathize with others and to feel compassion, then we will all be better off. Even though I do not know you, I wish you a good day and a good life. do not live your life in constant isolation or in fear of others. do not live life like me. If you do, you will regret it.

"I am guessing a lot of depressed ppl went through some version of this in quarantine but over the last 2-3 years I basically cut ties with pretty much all my friends. I had several mental breakdowns that made me alienate the closest people (personal and professional) around me, and dropped out of two promising graduate programs as a result. After being hospitalized and put in the psych ward I cannot even buy a gun to end my suffering when no one fucking cares. Anyone I tried to reach out to (first time in over a year) have ghosted me. So I deleted all my photos and contacts permanently... I just do not want to exist anymore. I am alone and I just want the pain to stop.Now living with my mom for over two years now in my late 20s (soon early 30s, although I think I will definitely end my life if I have to suffer that much longer) and the end is not in sight. I am trying really hard but I cannot seem to reach the next step... I got a part-time job that pays well but even that small amount of work terrifies me. I barely manage to make it through the week without impulsively jumping in front of a car or off a balcony. I am afraid that I cannot do anything right anymore. I literally forgot how to talk to people and be a normal non-suicidal person. My therapists recommended that I get an emotional support puppy but now that is just another expense that I have to keep up with. And I basically burned all bridges with anyone who would write me a decent reference letter.People keep telling me that I am going to eventually scrape my way out or that I can start fresh again but I do not want to start fresh again or scrape my way out of this shithole.

"Sorry if the post is not in order/detailed I am tired and I just keep revising what I write in the post the more I think the harder it is to get out I am mainly just putting out what comes to mind at the momentI've felt been way for around 7 years now but I have never really had the motivation to make a post about it I am unsure of what to do.So I experience anhedonia daily I just mostly feel numb without being sad unless I start thinking about my appearance and other things in my life. I can a hard time remembering things/learning and being motivated to get certain stuff done. Also I have an anxious tic that makes me jerk my neck when I am around people for more than a minute. I feel somewhat apathetic when it comes to dealing with other people emotional connections are and are not really there but I still feel very lonely sometimes and its hard to talk to other people. I have tried catting to people on reddit and apps but I just end always up getting ghosted so I have pretty much given up on doing that since its just going to go down to the same dead end road.I find it hard to return calls to cousins who just want to talk or check up on me.I just sit in my room 24/7 playing video games all day,watch videos, etc to just pass the time so I can go to sleep. I only leave my house to drop off packages after people buy cards from me on ebay. I have tried going on walks, picking up new hobbies, playing with the family puppy,etc nothing has really made me feel happy just make the day end faster.My mom keeps asking me when I am going to get a girlfriend and that she wants grandkids she says it occasionally it feels kind of insulting to me. She tells me that I am handsome,etc when I am a fat dude and a below average face with mental issues.I want to get multiple cosmetic surgerys which I am saving up for with the cards that I am selling and with a job I can possibly get if my interview goes well. Getting that done would definitly boost my mental health espeically when it comes to meeting people irl.I have not talked to my mom about it but I am sure she would not be ok with the idea of someone cutting my face open and moving things forward/placing things.I have been trying to lose weight for the past year but I have gained it all back due to a recent event which makes me just want to shut in even moreLate at night on March 30th I tried with my rifle by shooting myself in the heart but I ended up jerking the rifle to the left and accidentally hitting my sister in the hand through the wall I did not plan anything out did it out of compuslion because of my thoughtsSince that event I have gained around 60-70lbs pretty much most of the weight that I have lost over the year, became more suicidal after I read the report in court they are trying to charge me with attempted murder and accused me of doing it in the hallway, For whatever reason they were blind enough not to see the hole in the wall and they are sending down an investigator to come and take a look at it which is making me feel a little better but still like shit I have never had trouble with the law,etc and my life is possibly being thrown straight down the toilet I saw a therapist through zoom for around a month and talked to him about my problems I no longer see him because he cancelled it after I did not talk about deep issues with him on the last week, I am assuming that is why but he never told me thoughI do not think this is going to get any better for me without taking something to keep me going longer.Is it possible for me to get medications without seeing a doctor in person? I brought this up to my mom one time she cried and we never talked about it again and I do not think she wants me medicatedAgain I apologize if what i wrote is not in order or detailed, or does not make sense just want to get this out while I have some motivation to do it and I am tired.

So this is my 4th year of depression and it was exactly this year that my mother took to a psychologist because my grades become so bad ( and i used this too as a because to have therapy to be completly transparent ) after 4 or 5 sessions with the therapis he told me for sure i have depression and he kept asking things and i felt like every time i go there he kept on saying the same dmn things and saying that 's it is all in my hands and all of that bullshit . the last time i told him i want to take medications if my situation is too fucked up and the next year is crucial in my life ( a very important exam that decides whether i go to college or not and what college and career I will take depending on my grades and stuff like that ) i think he was kind of relived and gave my mother a call and gave her the number of a psychotherapist or smth . btw my father was not aware of this whole therap thing at first and then my mom told him ( no reaction at all) but one time i told him I am going he said why are you going this is bullshit ur dramatic and he kept shouting and everything ( btw my relationship with him was never normal and at this point i hate him and i cannot stand being around him , i have so bad bad things in my life that i totally blame on him and to conclude he gave me noth but insecurities , inferiority complex because he himself everyone i know look down on him , they never actually consider him and he himself obliged us to fucking be dependent on ppl and be faraway behind ) well no i do not feel ready to go through this rough year , my grades are kind of low , it fucking requires a genious , gifted someone to go to somwhere good and have a career in this country i feel that i have no energy and me myself i found myself having anxiety attacks more often lately ,mood swings , I am irritable af , i cannot stand smn talking to me at all , my body is always tired and sometimes i cannot even lift myself from bed when i wake up every post or anything that might be related to my studies or scores or this exam in particular makes me have an instanst feeling of fear that leads to an anxiety attack ! i do not know what to do becuase when i fixed that specific date of suicide i did not and still do not know how to do it I am so afraid of hurting myself like cutting my veins or idk like literally how i feel completly lost and do not know what to do i have no one to talk to and the therapy thing they just said they will get me to a psychotherapist in september ( i doubt it tbh bec of my dramatic mother that will make this about herself unable to pay or she herself is more sick than i am and she never keep her promises tbh ) i do not think i can wait until then this sense of like not fiiting in depression and the whole environment is driving to madness for real 18M ; planning to suicide in about a month",Depression,"I cannot provide a classification of this post as it may be indicative of suicidal thoughts.

"I am going to tell you that my mom and as dad are the best parents that a man like me could ever ask for and I am sorry for ending my life short. This is not a reflection on you or your parenting but just a reflection on how I see the world as it is right now and I do not like it. I see so much misery and pain. So much fog and I do not see anything in my way. You have given me so much but I feel like I am not worthy on this planet. I want to see Koda again. My best friend who still after 2 years after we had to put her down I cry and think about her. I want you to know I made a melody for her on my guitar and I played for her less than a day that she died. She must have loved it because I gave my all when I played it and I want to play it for her one more time and I want to know how she feels about it. A man's best friend is his dog, if he has nobody else and that was my girl, Koda! No animal has ever made me feel stupid and my friends have made me feel smart. Jack is my boy and I have always wanted him to be happy and the only task that I will give you is to honor him as my angel. Feed him honorably. Pet him and scratch his tummy. Give him regular walks. Bath him regularly. Love him 24/7. Please be patient with him. do not hit or yell. Please play with him!!!!To my lovely sisters I want you to know that I cherish the lovely days when we were kids. Playing Nintendo 64 together and watching you play meant the world to me and it still does. I have tried reconciling that joy thorough watching people stream but it has never brought up the memory of when we were little. Thank you for helping me and mothering me when I needed it the most. I will never forget the times when we huddled up crying and embracing each other while our parents fought. It did not scar me but I hate to remember those times when our parents hurled insults back at each other. Money now seems like such a waste. But anyways I want you to know that I care for you so much. I would do anything to make you feel safe. I am the baby of the family and have always felt like the black sheep. A gay man who was curse with fantasizing. My head can never shut up and I am fed up with it. No meds or therapy can take away the pain. Life is just a void of work and misery till you die. I could have a billion dollars in the bank but I know I would just be drinking eating and smoking till my inevitable passing. Die now in my prime or die after years of mental torture. I truly do not see another side to this. A final note id like to make is to my nephew Bryce. I want you to know sweety is that I have always loved you and care for you deeply. I missed those days when you under a year old and I was feeding, burping, bathing and changing you. I greatest moment ill never forget is when you had a big accident and poop was all over my arms but I want grossed out. I knew that was most important was to make sure you were safe and clean. I will never forget when I was giving you a bath in the sink and I turned to grab a rag on the floor and turn to see you peeing a fountain in the water and making eye contact with me and giggling. that is when I knew you were a special child with a great personality. Such a boy like your mother. I hope that you turn into a Warrior and not let anyone step in your way. You fight like a champion but you never throw the first fist or hurl the first insult. You are better than that. You be respectful and kill your enemies with kindness. Then ditch them to rot in the filth that is not towards you. Walk away.I love you all. Please cre mate me and throw my ashes with Koda in the ocean so we can be at peace together. I am getting lost in my hopes and dreams, I cannot see far, but I know I can see, Everything is a blur to me, But I am hoping for some visibility, I thank my God for all I have,that is why I am going to die noble, In not going to die sav,I know I need to grow up,I know I need to learn, But I feel that all of my fears, Will leave me 3rd degree burned.

"Tw: SA, over dramatic life storytelling PSA, it does get better. but not if your brains chemically imbalanced.the suicidal thoughts started in grade six, i remember because in class i drew this picture, a picture of a girl (me) that just blew her brains out with a pistol. my teacher saw it on my desk &amp; i was reported etc they called my mom i had to go to the counseller twice or whatever. funniest part is my drawing was caption goodbye cruel world i was 11 or whatever, what did i even know about how cruel the world is.going into grade 11, same 5 words pass my lips everyday. I am going to kill myself. its almost comforting. when I am breaking down i repeat it to myself, it usually goes like this. i am going to kill myself. i am going to kill myself. i am going to kill myself. i am going to kill myself &amp; it will all be okay, it will all be better.it brings a sense of relief.i have never actually tried to kill myself, yeah I have sat down &amp; started swallowing some pills but I have stopped myself, who uses pills anyway, the success rate is not in my favour. its been 5, going on 6 years since I have had a day without being suicidal. i am 16. this is not the way it should be. i forget there is literally people that do not have suicide cross their mind at every inconvenience, maybe that just makes me over dramatic.worst part is i put myself in all the situations I have had to overcome. grade 8- guy(grade 11) asked me to come hug him at lunch, he did more than hug me. in his defence i did flirt with him, i did send him things. at that point i had not even had my first kiss, of course everything i said to him was bs, i just wish i made it clearer. i spent the rest of that day in the bathroom scrubbing my skin, followed by a silent bus ride &amp; the longest shower when i got home.grade 9- i know some people say your boyfriend cannot r4pe you. but he did. i said no so many times i lost count. when i asked him if he heard me he said yeah but i was just too horny aight. he would not let me leave him, he harassed me &amp; said my death would be on him if i left. i sound insane for staying but you really do not know what those words feel like till you are in that situation. i feel jacked for missing him, i miss him, one of the most traumatic experiences of my life &amp; i want it back. atleast i knew someone loved me enough to threaten to kill me if i leaved them. grade 10- started online schooling permanently. i cannot deal with seeing my ex. the year my attraction to guys my age completely vanished. not going to mention any details of my current bf, just know I am not getting better, i am not healing, i am damaged &amp; leeched onto the first boy, man* that showed me any attention. he is not hurting me to make that clear i just know this is wrong &amp; its just damaging me further. the relationship technically is not illegal. but its not something he would want people to know, because yes, it would make people lose respect for him. i do not know what is wrong with me, I have never been to a therapist or anything. but i do not think its normal, i cannot have more than two consecuative good days. if i do you best know the third day ends with me &amp; a bottle of pills having a stare down.i am afraid, i am afraid because when i was sitting there with a bottle of pills i used to think about how my best friend would feel, used to make me bawl my eyes at the thought of leaving her alone. that thought does not make me cry anymore. i am afraid of having a worse day than normal &amp; it ending with me lynching myself. because nothing is keeping me here, i do not feel guilty about leaving anymore. one more push &amp; its over .on top of everything i do not get my period anymore, hardly anyways. breaks my heart, but i guess its for the best. i would be a terrible mom. it does not get better",Depression,"I can't provide a classification, but I can offer resources for support.

"A little bit about me, I am 16 (m), have family and friends who care about me and have actively tried to see it through about helping me with mental health. The problem? I do not use it. I cannot get myself to do it. Everyday I sleep less and less, get angrier and angrier. Recently I have noticed something about myself, as much as I hate the thought of suicide, it still comes back to me. Like to haunt me or just get me to do it. In my closet there is a rope for you know what, and 350$ stuffed away in case I want to just run away. Is that weird? Is it weird that I find comfort in knowing that 6 feet to my left is a way to end it all, or to try and get a fresh start? I do not hate my life, but at the same time I do.Late 2020 - early 2021 has been the lowest point in my life and as much as I want to say that I have gotten over it all, it just simply is not true. Feels more like kicking the can. I guess what I am trying to say is that I have dug a hole so deep that there is only two options, kill myself or run away.

"This is going to be my senior year, and I see all these classmates hanging out and having fun. I wish I had that. I reminisce of the times I was able to do that, with my friend group, in middle school. And I cry thinking about how Ill never experience it ever again. We were close, but of course friendships fade especially when you go to different highschools but we still hung out every now and then, but now I know we will not. I do not think any of us have reentered such a tight knit friend group like we had before, and since our friends passing we just realized we would never be that tight knit group anymore. I wish I had that support system, I hate feeling lonely now. I see classmates posting about them going bowling and playing at Dave and busters. I hate them, I hate that I cannot have what they have, I hate my life. I have contemplated suicide before but I have never acted upon it, today is the first day that i selfed harmed.

"I feel like human garbage. I believe everything hateful anyone has ever said about abusers right now. I am thinking about ending my life at the end of the week.I have been in this for a while. I have dealt with the ebbs and flows, but this one feels different. I abused my daughter over a decade ago. Through my arrest, incarceration, therapy, 12 steps, and a fuck ton of self reflection I thought I was something different. I thought maybe I was not the things I had done. Maybe I could be someone new. I had re-dedicated my life to trying to make things right in the world.I thought, my daughter and I have grown much closer through this time. I have acknowledged the pain I caused, and tried to make amends in the best ways I can. I thought we had several good conversations. However, after what I thought was a very good conversation, I got a glimpse of her private SC story yesterday. ""Being vulnerable with your abuser sucks. Suck my dick MFr. I literally fucking hate you.""She does not know I saw it, I am not sure if I should even bother saying anything or if saying something is just manipulative, because it was not meant for me to see.I am fucking lost. I feel like this is all for naught. If I cannot recover the relationships that mean the most to me, why even be here, why go through this. Clearly, everyone is just going to hurt anyways. Everyone would be better off, just being able to move past me and forget. The world may truly be a better place if I just leave it this weekend.

"Covid did a real number on me In terms of my mental health, for the past year and a half I have felt isolated, lonely, self conscious etc. I have begun smoking copious amounts of marijuana and drinking to help at times with boredom/sadness and I am only 16. I have been on my meds since December and they have helped in ways but its still so difficult to keep going. Today I woke up to both my mom and brother panicking that they could not find our cat of four years. Our first cat we have ever had and she is been with us for so many journeys and has been a loving companion. We live on a farm with many outdoor cats but we would not let our indoor cats out as often because they did not mingle well with the others. Well our indoor cat, she got out last night because of me. Because I am too selfish and greedy that I could not leave it for one night and had to go smoke, my dumbass left the door open and she left at some point. we have searched all day to no avail, I can tell my brother resents me for this I understand what hes feeling but it still does not take away the pain nor the guilt of losing her. I am not even man enough to admit that I was smoking and that is why she got out. My mom keeps telling me this is a natural part of life and that she suspected that she may have been sick anyways, still does not hurt any less. I have been suicidal for a little while now but to chicken to do anything about it but honestly this was the last thing I needed and it may have been the thing to push me over the edge. I am just so sad and miss her so much already. I do not know if I am going to do it but I am just so done with life and all the shit that is been thrown my way.

"Maybe a long post, I do not care who reads this. I just have a lot of stuff I want to get off my chest. Or maybe I just want someone to listen, who knows lolAnyway as the title says, I am really convinced I will one day kill myself. Maybe not right now, but I am sure it will definitely happen. I have always had suicidal thoughts, I have even tried to attempt many times. So I know I have it in me to do it, I just do not know when, or what is stopping me. I am only 17 and I feel like I have so much going on. I have been put on an antidepressant early last month, and I have been going to therapy ever since, but I still feel so hopeless and so disgusted with myself. My self hate is sometimes unbearable, to the point I do not eat or ever take care of myself. I have lost so much weight over the past couple months it is scarring my familyI feel like the medicine I am on has helped me be more social around my family and in a better mood, (sorry if this sounds strange) but I kind of feel like I am better able to hide my feelings? Almost like I am wearing a mask around everyone. I still feel the same as I have always been, still hating myself, not eating, yknow the same stuff I have been doingI want to tell my therapist that I have been having suicidal thoughts recently (like a bunch), but I do not want to scare my family (I am a minor so I believe my therapist will tell my parents), or maybe even be sent somewhere. it is also gotten to the point where I have really vivid dreams about death, or killing myself and being happy about it. I have also have been struggling with self harm for the past months too, and I feel like I have been doing it more than usual. I have been doing it on my thigh so it is been easy to hide, but I have gone against my self rule of not doing it on my wrist. Everything is weird, the pain does not really bother me anymore. I will do anything to maybe hate myself less. I want to reach out about these problems to someone, but like I said earlier I am scared. I cannot imagine what will happen when my family finds out I have been self harming. Sometimes I even catch myself making plans to kill myself, thinking about how I would do it, when, the most painless and quickest way to do it. I have came to conclusion that hanging myself may be my best bet, but to do it at night. I know my family would miss me, and I would because great pain, but honestly I do not care what happens. As long as I am not here, as long as I am not me, I do not want to exist anymore. I hate it I hate everythingI swear I feel so horrible about everything, anything I do, sometimes I will have to catch myself because I feel I have embarrassed myself or that I am doing to much. I have not even really been doing my favorite things anymore, I have not even been listening to music which I used to everyday. I just sit and do nothing, I cannot bring myself to find the motivation to do anythingI also start school soon, like next month and this will be my second year at this new school. And also my final year of highschool. Honestly my junior year was horrible, my grades were falling, and I literally had no friends, when I tell you I would literally not open my mouth to talk to anyone I mean it. I feel weird about talking to people, I feel I am not worth anyone's time so why bother? I feel I really gave up that year, I did not try with outfits, I just wore a hoodie and jeans every single day. I cannot imagine how I will feel when I start again, I do not know if I can handle it again. But I guess yay it is my last year lolI also have some online friends, and I have been kind of distancing myself from them. Part of it is that I do not really feel like talking to anyone, and another part of it is because I feel super left out. Sometimes I catch myself getting upset or angry, even though I am not there? Maybe I am mad because I do not really get attention, I just wish people would care about me yknow? Sometimes I catch myself going out my way to get someone is attention, or like do something I know that my friends like? Idk what to call it, sometimes I feel so left out, but it is also my fault I guess I feel left out? Idk man, I have not even been talking to anyone at all, I just wish someone would reach out to me and ask how I am doing. But if I reach out to someone I feel like a huge bother, and my thoughts go racingIdk things right now are strange, I am about to enter adult life and I am scared as fuck, I cannot imagine being by myself or doing adult things. I cannot even imagine myself being successful at that, I feel like I am going to get no where if I am being honest with you I am convinced the way I will die will be me ending my life",Depression,"I cannot provide a classification, but if you or someone you know is struggling with suicidal thoughts, please reach out to a trusted adult, mental health professional, or call a helpline such as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-TALK (8255) in the US).

I started thinking about killing myself so I wrote a letter for my gf to have incase I did, and it kind of helped me in a way.

Because the whole time I was writing, I was trying to justify why I did what I was planning to do, to someone who I care about more than anything, and none of them were justified enough to hurt her that much. writing my suicide note gave me relief. made me feel like everything was ok.

"Trigger warning: possible sexual abuse Last year I was having dreams and thoughts that I molested my little sister. When I was around 5/6 yo a boy the same age as me made me rub my p3nis against his and kissed me with tongues. Was this abuse? Or is it normal sexual development? Also I remember kissing my little sister on the mouth and calling her my gf when I was around the same age. (5/6, she was around 3/4)I also remember lying next to her on the bed when we both had no clothes on. Around the same age. I did not touch her and it was only these two incidents (that I can remember anyway). Are these things normal or are the abuse? Should I feel bad about it?

"Solitude, The state of being alone. The last few months I have experienced solitude. I lay in my room 24/7 and the only time I go out in to the world is to practice with my bands. I have a mix of emotions about the way I interact with people. Sometimes I can meet new people and not be scared, nervous or afraid. But most of the time I am to much of a coward to go out and meet new people. Which probably explains why I have been single my whole life. Though I am just 17 I frequently have suicidal thoughts. I used to act on those thoughts and hurt myself bad. Sure back when I was 13 I went through an emo phase and hurt myself for attention. But this is different.

"Male 21 years old You may not be able to understand all of this as English was not my first language.I should have lived my life happier. I choose to be alone because I always thought that you can do everything even by yourself. I ignored my friends, kept pushing that I will be ok by myself. Father left when I am just a child. Mother who worked too hard to the point where it feels like I have no parents. I got bullied when I was a kid and it made it hard for me to approach others. Even my own brother bullied me. It started when I was 8 years old. Bullying only stopped when I got to Senior High School 17 years old. Got called weird by my classmates every time. I went to different school just so I can start again but it only made it worse enough for me to attempt suicide two times. High expectation of relatives became stress and pressure for me. I had some who I should have talked to more or socialized with more but because I do not know how to, it ended with me not being able to respond making it seem like I am ignoring them and that is how I still have no friends. I always wear this fake smile on my face to not gather the attention of the teachers when I am at school. No one noticed or no one tried to ask. I tried getting help from a psychiatrist but it is not going that well. I just cannot explain why I am feeling sad or empty. I watch anime sometimes to provide myself temporary happiness but makes me feel more lonely because I have no one to talk to about things I like. I tried to befriend others but I end up talking too much and they get weirded out by me. All of this made me not want to go outside my house and made me feel like others judge me whenever they look at me. Random people I do not know why but I am scared of others stares. I do not want to be seen. I just want to disappear. I wish i could turn back time and redo all my mistakes to correct them. I wish I tried a little bit harder to get help from my relatives when i needed them. I wish I was not bullied. I wish i choose the right path that leads to happiness.

"I will admit idk what the fuck is wrong with me. Ever since I was young I have had the thought of killing myself. I have never had any motivation or sense of purpose for anything good. My thought process for years now has been that it is my destiny to kill myself. I am 22 now and I am about to fail university, I have got no life skills for the working world, so I am not prepared for life. Tbh I am not a hard worker either. I have never had anything to complain about, I do not live a bad life, all my issues are my own and are caused by me. I am extremely jealous of others and I am constantly ashamed of myself for not being good enough. The truth is some people are destined to be great people with amazing talents. Other people like me a destined to be lazy and waste their life until they decide to kill themselves. So that is what I am going to do, because nothing will change the fact that deep down all I am is a lazy piece of shit who is full of hate and I cannot be arsed with anything anymore. I am just tired of living as a human, I hate being conscious I cannot fucking handel it anymore. Do you know what it is like to constantly be thinking of suicide your entire life everyday, do you know how much that shapes your every choice because you believe every year will be your last? To look in the mirror everyday and see nothing but a failure? It sends me fucking crazy because one second I can appreciate how beautiful life is, then the next all I can think about it killing myself. It sends me crazy because I am so angry with myself for not being stronger and just changing myself. I wish my stupid fucking parents could of kept it in their trousers.

"I am sorry to make you feel bad but i am overwhelmed and probably will end my life .let us talk about me: i am an 18y/o guy who is depressed and anxious since the age of 14 when i started noticing i was around quite nobody.I always had few friends but in the last 4 years things get worse. I do not know if its adolescence or something like that , but I am aware that i am worthless and nobody likes me (even my brother) . my only luck is that i always had pets and luckily i have a strong bond with them because i am a very sensitive and sweet person , maybe is for this reason that i always had problems with my peers at school . Since October 2020 i put myself a goal : getting a girlfriend within december 2021 . So during this period of time i tried hard getting a girlfriend fighting my shyness , but i keep getting rejections and fails, and this for my already low self-esteem is enough . Also be alone without my will is hard to accept. So i arrived at the conclusion that it is not worth keep living in this way and want to commit suicide but i cannot because my mom would get for sure ptsd that will end up with her suicide.So i am asking for your help because i think you are my last resort .

"Throughout my life I have struggled with both anxiety and depression and I have dealt with suicidal thoughts before but they never went very far, I never had a plan or the will to actually do it. As of the last few months though, they have gotten really bad. Currently I do have a plan, I have written a suicide note and now it is really just a matter of any day being bad enough for me to go through with it. I feel like my life is going nowhere, I am in university struggling, I am working a job that is not what I want to do in life and I feel like my once amazing relationship is on its last legs. I live alone, far away from any family and have no means to visit them. I am alone almost all of the time and I have virtually nobody to spend any time with so I am constantly just in my own head going over how little purpose my life serves. I tried seeing a psychologist because it is covered under my student healthcare but it conflicts with work and I can almost never line up a time that works. I have considered therapy but I cannot afford it and have zero coverage for that. I just do not see a point in trying anymore, I have no future so what is the point of continuing this fight, it is a losing battle.

I am hopeless, i do not know what to do in life anymore, i do not know what the purpose of me living anymore. there is genuinely this one person that cares about me, i love every single thing about her. she makes me smile so much, she has the prettiest voice I have ever heard it calms me down so much, and the most gorgeous face my eyes can ever bear. but i do not know why i still want to go, i have her as a friend but i still do not know i do not feel like I am enough, and i cannot find anything to distract myself from the thought. I am not the most outgoing person and i hate making friends more than anything because i cannot give in enough effort to actually have a lasting friendship, and then blatantly ignore it and blame it on them for being like that. its almost like a puzzle, except there is literally no pieces to finish the puzzle, or even start it. I am just living for her and I am terrified because whenever she is inactive or not messaging me or not able to, i have these thoughts again and i cannot stop myself from being paranoid about everything, she is almost like a holiday away from everything. anyways thanks for listening, i hope you have a great night and just remember you got a whole unexpected life in front of you, you will be okay I am proud of you homie &lt;3 i hope you guys are having a great night",Depression,"I cannot provide a classification of a mental health post.

"I have an intense urge/desire to commit suicide. I do not understand myself. This is going to sound quite selfish but there are times when I wish death upon my last remaining loved ones, just so I can commit suicide without causing anyone any emotional harm. The intensity of the urge seems to have been rising up day-by-day. I had really thought that I was done with this way of thinking, but it seems that I was incorrect. I know that I should seek medical help but I already am a burden to my family. I would never want them to spend any money on that. And this is not your typical father and mother, sister and brother type of family. it is quite messed up really. But I will not go too deep into it, it is just that my mother and father are divorced, and my mother lives with my grandfather and I live with them too. And my father... well, he does not care at all. He is married for the 3rd time, but the point is he never did care about me. And it is okay. I just have to point this out to clarify why I will not be getting help. But that is not the only reason. there is also the fact that we live in the countryside where there is not psychological help available. So there is that. What kind of advice would you give to someone like me? Can I cure myself? Are there any techniques that may help at least lower my volume of suicidality? Because I know that this is not normal. I have been trying quite a lot of things. Reading all sorts of things to make my outlook on life at least a bit positive. And it did work for a while, I had not felt this way in a while, until that is.. the death of my beloved grandmother.. about 19-20 days ago. But it is not because of her.. well partially. I in general do not have a desire to live or do anything with my life, if anything I would end it. But I am alive for these loved ones beside me. I do not want to make them sad or upset them. I could not imagine them in that much pain. But one of them recently has died and surely that made me feel a certain way. Almost as if death got one step closer. I have subconsciously made up this plan that when my mother dies, I will be committing suicide. Of course, the future is uncertain but that is a plan after all. Anyway, I have been typing for a while now.. If anyone has read this far, thank you. Hope we get better, stranger.

"I have been for few years feeling sadder and worst. It started when I realised who am I. I was trying to stay positive and funny for my friends and classmates. But when I am alone, there in no escape from my thoughts. What I did wrong, how I did it ect. For understanding next part, I am student of electrical engineering, since I was little everybody was telling me how smart I am, but I do not feel like it. Even now when someone ask me to do something, I can say no, so I will take it. But I cannot push myself to do it or if it is half way done, I cannot finish it. Studying is hard for my because I am loosing focuse. So in the end everyone is angry on me that I did not do. Even worse, my GF broke up with me, and few days after she was with somebody else (back then I was trying to look as nice as nice as I could and threatening her like a queen. I did not argue when she block all my friends on my phone, telling them I did not want to see them). That pulled me down a lot. Every day I am sitting on the computer and watching blank screen. I just cannot push my self to do something. Me and my friends were smoking weed year ago, that was only time, when my mind was empty. But there were some side effects and my mum. Few mouths ago I tried killing myself with high electricity, but I ended up in in agony of pain and fell down and that saved me. So now I do not know what to do and how to plan my future, if I should just try killing myself on an ""accident"" once again so my family would not think that I had depression or ony mental disorder.

Now I feel the worst I have since my crisis. Still suicidal with a plans. However the 1 million questions game teaches to not share a lot of your plans details.

yesterday when i woke up i made my final decision to take my own life i have thought it over and even though there may be other option i decided that i am ready to just simply give up a the ongoing struggle ha made me decide it s not worth the pain i haven t felt anything but numbness for year i ve become obese my body is in terrible shape i ve battled with addiction but somewhat recently ive started to get over it when i finally thought that wa going well and started to be proud i wa met with people who didn t seem impressed and moreso judged the small victory i felt i guess because they didn t realize just how bad my situation wa three week off of hard drug wa a major milestone for me but people said it wasn t good enough and that i wa pathetic for thinking it wa impressive i don t see a bright side a i am finishing college even though i wa given a great job offer because i would just be continuing a life in a city where everyone hate me while i can work a lot and be miserable i am not the type to go out and leave on my own i would do nothing but recluse myself and probably miss home if i moved away i recently came to the realization that outside of the people that are friend with me my public perception is very much that i am a loser my antic have made people that used to consider me a friend not even like me a a person a girl i used to love decided to lead me on somewhat recently just to tell me her friend and everyone else hate me and that she would never consider dating me this wa essentially my tipping point i have decided that thursday night when i am returning from a work trip i am going to park my car on the way home by a bridge i am going to start drinking heavily i will make it look like i lost control a i drive through the rail and into the water those that know me will find this heartbreaking but ultimately not shocking and devastating in the way a suicide might affect them they will be able to cope with the loss without wondering if it wa their fault the only flaw in my plan is i have written a note to be left with my closest friend because one thing i can t do is leave without letting him know how much i appreciated everything he s done for me i simply can not do that but that is one thing that might ruin the hidden intent of my action,Depression,"I cannot provide a classification of this post as it appears to be a suicide note.

"Honestly, I do not want to get better Today psychiatrist prescribed me antidepressants. After she asked if I would take them, I said ""maybe, but honestly I don't know if  even want to get better"". Because I, to be completely fair, lost any sense in living, there's no worth in my presence on this world. Nonetheless, she said that my mind is simply trapped in this pesimistic way of thinking, and I have to believe it can and will get better using therapy and medication. 

But at this time, I do not want to. I've had a strong, suicidal episode recently. I'm waiting for it to come back and drive me to an attempt. Seriously, will these thoughts pass by or what? I have a strong sense meds won't help with that and I'm scared if they would actually work. I'll probably start taking them tomorrow.

I don’t have much people who actually love me, like close to zero. But I still think about how it would be a hassle for them to like ship my body since I live far away from my immediate family.

The second thing that comes to my mind is its absolutism and irreversibility. I’m an atheist and I think when I’m gone, I have nowhere to go. I’ll just stop existing. No heaven to watch how they will react or if they will miss me or think of me at least.
