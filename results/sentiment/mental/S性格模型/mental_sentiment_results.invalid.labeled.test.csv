"I figured I would rant in a depression sub more than anywhere else. I always feel like I should not have any real reason to be depressed because I live in a first world country where there is an abudance of opportunity for anything you want. However, I have feelings of self-doubt, pity, anxiety and a general low self-esteem most of the time. I am 23 years old and I hate my life. I graduated in Mechanical Engineering in August 2020 and I still have not found a job in my field. This is partially the reason why my depression is bad. I have never had a girlfriend in my entire life and the last girl I tried to talk to ended up ghosting me. I do not particulary blame them either as it is my fault at the end of the day. I cannot beat the depression no matter how hard I try. I have followed every piece of advice I can take such as exercising, eating well, sleeping 8 hours a day, getting sunlight and I still feel like a piece of shit more and more. I would believe this might have to do with childhood-teenage trauma that I have had. My brother was not the best person in my life, which sucks becasue up to when I was 13 years old, he was amazing and awesome. Afterwards, he would because me a lot of physical abuse and mental abuse. He gave me two black eyes in school which many teachers would question if I was okay at home. I was not but I did not let them know that to protect my brother from receiving a bad reputation. I told my parents, but they did not really do anything about it besides a stern talking to my brother. He left me in -15 temperature one time for a few hours where I was just wandering the neighbourhood (I live fairly far from any store so I did not really have a shelter). The thing that makes it worse is that he has a successful life with a loving wife and amazing friends. It makes me sad that people can harm others and still never receive any karma. The next factor is the amount of bullying I received as a kid from my former friends. Surprisingly the ones who became my bully was my friend. This friend is very charismatic and good at getting friends himself. Due to my shyness and having virtually no backbone, I became a really easy target when we started highschool as he was able to convince other kids to bully me as well. The bullying was not anything crazy, just name-calling and making me look dumb a lot. However, they did this every day and it ended up taking a toll on me. These kids are also super successful now and have great relationships. I realized more in University how pathetic and below average I am to my peers. Everyone else can do things much more easier than I can, have much more talents, and are generally smarter than me. I have extreme social anxiety and I always struggle showing my persoanlity around others. Maybe it is a defense mechanism and I will be betrayed again. (Some Good Will Hunting type of shit lol) If it was not for TV shows and the internet, I would be a lot more depressed than I am now. I honestly believe I am a burden to everyone around me and my parents are making it more clear that they do not want me around since I have not obtained a job in my field and am sorta just coasting in life right now. Thank you for reading this post if you have, but if not I understand as well.

"it is been a rough year for everyone. I thought I was starting to bounce back a few weeks ago when I broke up with my boyfriend, because it felt like a weight was lifted off my chest. I had more energy, I started actually texting people back, I started tackling my enormous workload that had piled up, and I made plans with friends.But then 2 weeks ago I got nearly blackout drunk at a house party because the guy I started casually sleeping with brought a different girl to the party. It just made me feel so worthless and shit, so I drank way too much, picked a fight with a friend, then walked home and made a shitty weak suicide attempt. The number of pills I swallowed was nowhere near enough to actually kill me but it was definitely enough to keep me vomiting for the next 36 hours.I came back to work after taking a sick day, and was immediately overwhelmed with time-sensitive, critical tasks that came out of nowhere. Then Thursday night, my cat got sick and spent 2 nights at the emergency vet hospital. She might have cancer, but at least she is back home now and seeming better.I am at work right now, staring at the list of shit I have to do that is too long, too full of overdue stuff that I will never have time to do, and I just cannot fucking engage. I have been in this job for 2 years now and I want some career growth but I do not have the time or energy to apply to stuff. I missed out on applying to a really great opportunity because I was puking my guts out when the deadline passed.I just feel like I will never reach that surface. Nothing will ever get better, I will never grow and be more successful, I will never be able to maintain relationships, I will never be able to lead a good life.I just want to fucking die but I cannot seem to figure out a good suicide method.

"Before I explain why I am about to end my life, I want to clarify that I am not advocating for suicide and if I could help it, I would ensure that no one has suicidal feelings. But I am not in control. That said, I just want to get this post out there as one final affirmation of my existence. Now, as for why I am going to commit suicide, there are two reasons: My social ineptitude and my fear of human depravity. I will first talk about my social ineptitude and then I will delve deeper in the depravity of human kind and why it has fed my depression.I have been an outsider my whole life. While I did have a close friend group, I never felt like I ""clicked"" with any of them on a personal level. Regardless of how much I tried, I always felt different from other people, and not in a good way. If others were to describe me, they would probably say that I was ""weird"" or ""odd"" but not in any particular way. I am not sure how to explain it, but I have felt like there is some part of me that is fundamentally different from the rest of humanity. In some ways I feel subhuman, and that prevents me from actually forming meaningful connections with others. Speaking of meaningful connections, despite being in my mid-twenties, I have been single for my whole life. I have not even held hands with a girl before. Yeah, I know you are probably laughing at me right now, but it is true. I have been rejected more times than I can count and honestly, I try to tell myself that I have gotten used to it, but really, it is weighed down on me for so damn long. The only people who have been there for me are my family members, but as fucked up as it sounds, not even they are enough to keep me from feeling unbelievably lonely. I feel like if I cannot interact properly with others, I cannot function as an adult in society, and if I cannot function in society, then I might as well clock out. Additionally, I have been incredibly insecure about my mental and physical abilities, both of which I feel like I sorely lack. This has also created a social impediment between myself and others as it feeds my inferiority complex. As for the second reason why I am going to kill myself, most people are depraved. Plain and simple. I have been a true crime junkie for a while and hell, has it taken its toll on my mental health. I cannot go outside without worrying that someone is going to shoot, stab, or kidnap me. You might be thinking that mass murderers and violent criminals make up a small percentage of the overall population, and while true, I believe that most humans are inherently violent. Humans are just as willing to excuse violence as we are willing to condemn it. do not believe me? Look at any video on Youtube with the title ""Home-owner shoots robbers in home invasion"" or something like that, then go to the comments. I will guarantee you that most of the people in the comments section will rejoice and applaud the home owner for either gravely injuring or killing the criminals. Now I understand the appeal for self-defense, do not get me wrong. I do believe that in certain scenarios self-defense is necessary, but I do not believe that the injury or loss of a human life should be celebrated, regardless of the person. The fact that this opinion is unpopular terrifies me. It seems to me that people inherently have a violent side. This violent side is also brought out when you add personal property into the equation. I remember a few years ago I read a news article detailing an incident where a store owner killed some guy who tried to steal a pack of candy from a convenience store. The website allowed for people to comment below the article, and surprise surprise, people applauded the store owner and praised him for killing some person who tried to steal a bag of gummies or some shit. I am still baffled that people think that ending a living soul for some candy was a fair transaction. This has further pushed me away from human interaction as I feel like I cannot trust anyone anymore. Which raises the question, why am I writing this suicide note on a forum for the purpose of being read by others? Well, I do not distrust all of humanity, and I believe that this subreddit may have like-minded and kind people who will just let me say my piece before I die. In short, I am going to kill myself because I have experienced extreme social isolation and I have developed a general mistrust of human kind. I believe if humanity works on its ability to empathize with others and to feel compassion, then we will all be better off. Even though I do not know you, I wish you a good day and a good life. do not live your life in constant isolation or in fear of others. do not live life like me. If you do, you will regret it.

So this is my 4th year of depression and it was exactly this year that my mother took to a psychologist because my grades become so bad ( and i used this too as a because to have therapy to be completly transparent ) after 4 or 5 sessions with the therapis he told me for sure i have depression and he kept asking things and i felt like every time i go there he kept on saying the same dmn things and saying that 's it is all in my hands and all of that bullshit . the last time i told him i want to take medications if my situation is too fucked up and the next year is crucial in my life ( a very important exam that decides whether i go to college or not and what college and career I will take depending on my grades and stuff like that ) i think he was kind of relived and gave my mother a call and gave her the number of a psychotherapist or smth . btw my father was not aware of this whole therap thing at first and then my mom told him ( no reaction at all) but one time i told him I am going he said why are you going this is bullshit ur dramatic and he kept shouting and everything ( btw my relationship with him was never normal and at this point i hate him and i cannot stand being around him , i have so bad bad things in my life that i totally blame on him and to conclude he gave me noth but insecurities , inferiority complex because he himself everyone i know look down on him , they never actually consider him and he himself obliged us to fucking be dependent on ppl and be faraway behind ) well no i do not feel ready to go through this rough year , my grades are kind of low , it fucking requires a genious , gifted someone to go to somwhere good and have a career in this country i feel that i have no energy and me myself i found myself having anxiety attacks more often lately ,mood swings , I am irritable af , i cannot stand smn talking to me at all , my body is always tired and sometimes i cannot even lift myself from bed when i wake up every post or anything that might be related to my studies or scores or this exam in particular makes me have an instanst feeling of fear that leads to an anxiety attack ! i do not know what to do becuase when i fixed that specific date of suicide i did not and still do not know how to do it I am so afraid of hurting myself like cutting my veins or idk like literally how i feel completly lost and do not know what to do i have no one to talk to and the therapy thing they just said they will get me to a psychotherapist in september ( i doubt it tbh bec of my dramatic mother that will make this about herself unable to pay or she herself is more sick than i am and she never keep her promises tbh ) i do not think i can wait until then this sense of like not fiiting in depression and the whole environment is driving to madness for real 18M ; planning to suicide in about a month",Depression,"I cannot provide a classification of this post as it contains graphic details about suicide.

"Jk. Idk how else to start this shit. I am killing myself in three months. Ill go to a psychiatrist in 1 month. But if it does not change anything. I will absolutely drive to the Bay Area and kill myself after going to all my favorite places, blow all my money away, and THEN obviously jump off the bay bridge like the stupid cunt I am. I have had this plan for years, I have never gotten help for my extreme constant intrusive thoughts, and for a month and a half I have been (adding onto my obvious symptoms and suicidal thoughts) 100% down, crying 5+ times a day for no reason or having periods of complete rage with no explained because. I have plenty of reasons to live, but cannot find a logical or real reason to NOT kill myself, if that makes sense. I see no point in living like this, and I have always planned to do it at 25 at the latest. I am just going to do it 6 years early, I am done. I feel hatred for everyone except my closest family. I feel sorry for my family for having to have to deal with this. I realize Scde is self serving, and selfish, and frowned on, but I am at the point where I do not care, I am not wanting to be talked down. I have absolutely no friends. NONE. I would like a friend, but that is all, maybe Ill make it to 25 with a friend. Maybe. And 3 months is plenty of time to allow change guys okay? I will not rely on the friend literally. I will not even tell them what I am planning, I just want something to pass the time till 25. But in three months it may not change.

"Tw: SA, over dramatic life storytelling PSA, it does get better. but not if your brains chemically imbalanced.the suicidal thoughts started in grade six, i remember because in class i drew this picture, a picture of a girl (me) that just blew her brains out with a pistol. my teacher saw it on my desk &amp; i was reported etc they called my mom i had to go to the counseller twice or whatever. funniest part is my drawing was caption goodbye cruel world i was 11 or whatever, what did i even know about how cruel the world is.going into grade 11, same 5 words pass my lips everyday. I am going to kill myself. its almost comforting. when I am breaking down i repeat it to myself, it usually goes like this. i am going to kill myself. i am going to kill myself. i am going to kill myself. i am going to kill myself &amp; it will all be okay, it will all be better.it brings a sense of relief.i have never actually tried to kill myself, yeah I have sat down &amp; started swallowing some pills but I have stopped myself, who uses pills anyway, the success rate is not in my favour. its been 5, going on 6 years since I have had a day without being suicidal. i am 16. this is not the way it should be. i forget there is literally people that do not have suicide cross their mind at every inconvenience, maybe that just makes me over dramatic.worst part is i put myself in all the situations I have had to overcome. grade 8- guy(grade 11) asked me to come hug him at lunch, he did more than hug me. in his defence i did flirt with him, i did send him things. at that point i had not even had my first kiss, of course everything i said to him was bs, i just wish i made it clearer. i spent the rest of that day in the bathroom scrubbing my skin, followed by a silent bus ride &amp; the longest shower when i got home.grade 9- i know some people say your boyfriend cannot r4pe you. but he did. i said no so many times i lost count. when i asked him if he heard me he said yeah but i was just too horny aight. he would not let me leave him, he harassed me &amp; said my death would be on him if i left. i sound insane for staying but you really do not know what those words feel like till you are in that situation. i feel jacked for missing him, i miss him, one of the most traumatic experiences of my life &amp; i want it back. atleast i knew someone loved me enough to threaten to kill me if i leaved them. grade 10- started online schooling permanently. i cannot deal with seeing my ex. the year my attraction to guys my age completely vanished. not going to mention any details of my current bf, just know I am not getting better, i am not healing, i am damaged &amp; leeched onto the first boy, man* that showed me any attention. he is not hurting me to make that clear i just know this is wrong &amp; its just damaging me further. the relationship technically is not illegal. but its not something he would want people to know, because yes, it would make people lose respect for him. i do not know what is wrong with me, I have never been to a therapist or anything. but i do not think its normal, i cannot have more than two consecuative good days. if i do you best know the third day ends with me &amp; a bottle of pills having a stare down.i am afraid, i am afraid because when i was sitting there with a bottle of pills i used to think about how my best friend would feel, used to make me bawl my eyes at the thought of leaving her alone. that thought does not make me cry anymore. i am afraid of having a worse day than normal &amp; it ending with me lynching myself. because nothing is keeping me here, i do not feel guilty about leaving anymore. one more push &amp; its over .on top of everything i do not get my period anymore, hardly anyways. breaks my heart, but i guess its for the best. i would be a terrible mom. it does not get better",Depression,"I cannot provide a classification of this post as it may be indicative of suicidal thoughts and self-harm.

"A little bit about me, I am 16 (m), have family and friends who care about me and have actively tried to see it through about helping me with mental health. The problem? I do not use it. I cannot get myself to do it. Everyday I sleep less and less, get angrier and angrier. Recently I have noticed something about myself, as much as I hate the thought of suicide, it still comes back to me. Like to haunt me or just get me to do it. In my closet there is a rope for you know what, and 350$ stuffed away in case I want to just run away. Is that weird? Is it weird that I find comfort in knowing that 6 feet to my left is a way to end it all, or to try and get a fresh start? I do not hate my life, but at the same time I do.Late 2020 - early 2021 has been the lowest point in my life and as much as I want to say that I have gotten over it all, it just simply is not true.

"Lately I have been fixated on my future, especially a future with my partner. I am turning 14 this September and I am freaking out. I have been telling myself since I was 11 that I would kill myself before I turn 14. I was planning on actually doing it but things have changed. I am just beyond happy that I found someone who seems to perfect yet still loves someone as not perfect as me. he is been with me for a few months over a year, and we tell each other everything. we have been talking about our future together, like what our wedding would be like, where our future home would be, our future pets ect. I love the future we have created in our minds. I would do anything for that to be our reality. Lately I have been feeling almost normal. Like the pure pain of life is no more than a slight pinch. I still have those days that make me want to end everything, but I have a lot of days where I am happy, and excited for my life.I have not felt that way in a long time, I am not sure what to do now....

"Weird suicide thoughts I’m severely suicidal and do self-harm almost everyday. Only on one part of the body so even if I have band aid on it all the time, it won’t look as weird if I have several.

But what I want to share when I think about killing myself, the first thing that comes to my mind is how it would inconvenience everyone around me. I don’t have much people who actually love me, like close to zero. But I still think about how it would be a hassle for them to like ship my body since I live far away from my immediate family.

The second thing that comes to my mind is its absolutism and irreversibility. I’m an atheist and I think when I’m gone, I have nowhere to go. I’ll just stop existing. No heaven to watch how they will react or if they will miss me or think of me at least.
