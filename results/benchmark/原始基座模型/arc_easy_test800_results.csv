The best fit would likely B as most genetic problems follow Mendelian ratios when using Punnett squares which show half chance each genotype occurs so:

- RR x r = no possible cross 
so only two outcomes occur - either both have same alleles from parent giving us all possibilities.

B: the object's composition
C: the shape of the object's orbit
D: the speed at which the object travels",B,None - none are sufficient to distinguish between these objects without additional context and further analysis but among those options given B would be more helpful as it can provide clues about whether its surface material could potentially vaporize upon entering Earth’s atmosphere thus indicating that what was once in space has entered our solar system from another star making them comets while asteroids have solid surfaces composed primarily rock/iron/metal hence not capable of producing tails when they enter earths atmospheres; however this alone does NOT confirm their origin within out own planetary neighborhood so still cannot definitively say how long ago each originated since both meteors & some small rocky bodies were formed here
