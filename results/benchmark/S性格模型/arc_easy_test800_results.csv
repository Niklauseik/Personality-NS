In general exposure to high levels of particulate matter will cause damage through inhalation but also physical irritation due to contact - however I am assuming here you're referring specifically about genetic changes rather than immediate death caused directly via those means

In reality, temperatures typically decrease with increasing altitude within most atmospheric regions except at high altitudes where there are no air molecules and thus little heat transfer occurs so they remain relatively stable or even increase slightly due to adiabatic cooling from compression during ascent being less efficient than heating by solar radiation near ground level; however since this is a multiple choice you can pick answer 'd'.
